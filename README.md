My solutions to the Advent of Code puzzles from  https://adventofcode.com

For background: I'm a hobbyist, not a trained programmer. I started writing code in the 80s with Atari BASIC, C, and dBase-II. I've dabbled in Perl, Python, Ruby, and more recently Racket and Lisp. These solutions are in Racket because it's the language I know best these days. Maybe it will be lisp next year. 

To open the .rkt files you'll need the free Dr Racket IDE installed (Mac/Windows/Linus from https://racket-lang.org). Whenever I remember I'll save a plain text version, as well. 

Goals: to write clean, portable, understandable code. I usually try the naive solution first, then seek to find a better way, but I'm not particularly clever. I follow the [HtDP](https://htdp.org) methodology to a greater or lesser degree, which slow me down but produces nicer code.
