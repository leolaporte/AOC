My solutions to the Advent of Code puzzles from  https://adventofcode.com

My answers and the run time in milliseconds are at the bottom of each solution. 

For background: I'm a hobbyist, not a trained programmer. I started writing code in the 80s with Atari BASIC, C, and dBase-II. I've dabbled in Perl, Python, Ruby, and more recently Racket and Lisp. These solutions are in Racket because it's the language I know best these days. Maybe it will be Lisp next year.
