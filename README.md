# AOC
My solutions to the Advent of Code puzzles from  https://adventofcode.com

I'm not saving my problem input here - you'll need to get your own  problem input from the AOC web site. Save it as ```input#.txt``` (where ```#``` represents the day) in the same dir as the Racket file to run these solutions for yourself. My answers and the run time in milliseconds are at the bottom of each solution. 

For background: I'm a hobbyist, not a trained programmer. I started writing code in the 80s with Atari BASIC, C, and dBase-II. I've dabbled in Perl, Python, Ruby, and more recently Racket and Lisp. These solutions are in Racket because it's the language I know best these days. Maybe it will be Lisp next year. 

To open the .rkt files you'll need the free Dr Racket IDE installed (Mac/Windows/Linux from https://racket-lang.org).
