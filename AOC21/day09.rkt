; --- Day 9: Smoke Basin ---
; 
; These caves seem to be lava tubes. Parts are even still volcanically active; small
; hydrothermal vents release smoke into the caves that slowly settles like rain.
; 
; If you can model how the smoke flows through the caves, you might be able to avoid it
; and be that much safer. The submarine generates a heightmap of the floor of the nearby
; caves for you (your puzzle input).
; 
; Smoke flows to the lowest point of the area it's in. For example, consider the following
; heightmap:
; 
; 2199943210
; 3987894921
; 9856789892
; 8767896789
; 9899965678
; 
; Each number corresponds to the height of a particular location, where 9 is the highest
; and 0 is the lowest a location can be.
; 
; Your first goal is to find the low points - the locations that are lower than any of its
; adjacent locations. Most locations have four adjacent locations (up, down, left, and right);
; locations on the edge or corner of the map have three or two adjacent locations,
; respectively. (Diagonal locations do not count as adjacent.)
; 
; In the above example, there are four low points, all highlighted: two are in the first
; row (a 1 and a 0), one is in the third row (a 5), and one is in the bottom row (also a 5).
; All other locations on the heightmap have some lower adjacent location, and so are not low points.
; 
; The risk level of a low point is 1 plus its height. In the above example, the risk levels
; of the low points are 2, 1, 6, and 6. The sum of the risk levels of all low points in the
; heightmap is therefore 15.
; 
; Find all of the low points on your heightmap. What is the sum of the risk levels of all low
; points on your heightmap?

;  --- Part Two ---
; 
; Next, you need to find the largest basins so you know what areas are most important to avoid.
; 
; A basin is all locations that eventually flow downward to a single low point. Therefore,
; every low point has a basin, although some basins are very small. Locations of height 9 do not
; count as being in any basin, and all other locations will always be part of exactly one basin.
; 
; The size of a basin is the number of locations within the basin, including the low point. The
; example above has four basins.
; 
; The top-left basin, size 3:
; 
; 2199943210
; 3987894921
; 9856789892
; 8767896789
; 9899965678
; The top-right basin, size 9:
; 
; 2199943210
; 3987894921
; 9856789892
; 8767896789
; 9899965678
; The middle basin, size 14:
; 
; 2199943210
; 3987894921
; 9856789892
; 8767896789
; 9899965678
; The bottom-right basin, size 9:
; 
; 2199943210
; 3987894921
; 9856789892
; 8767896789
; 9899965678
; Find the three largest basins and multiply their sizes together. In the above example,
; this is 9 * 14 * 9 = 1134.
; 
; What do you get if you multiply together the sizes of the three largest basins?
; 


;; NOTES:
;; Hmmm. How to solve this. I can start with the low points found in part one, then expand
;; out from every point until I reach a 9 or the border of the grid. This will produce the
;; basins. All I need to save, though, is the number of points in the basin. The solution
;; is the product of the three largest basins' sizes.

;; A basin is a tree with the node values = 9. I can use CAR/CDR recursion to walk the
;; tree collecting the points as I go. Counting the visited points will give me the number
;; of points in the basin.
