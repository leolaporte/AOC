  --- Day 5: Hydrothermal Venture ---
    
  Consider only horizontal and vertical lines. At how many points do at least two lines overlap?

 NOTES
 This looks pretty easy. Too easy...
 Convert the input to a list of lines, each line stored as four points (x1 y1 x2 y2)
 Convert each line into the set of points it touches: ((x1,y1)..(x2,y2))
 for each point in the set increment that point's entry in a hash table, if a point
 is not in the hash add it, count total number of points with more than one entry

 Oh and it WAS too easy... there are two additional tricky points
 1) the provided end points can be right->left as well as left->right, and bottom->top
 as well as top->bottom (make sure to account for those)
 2) some of the provided lines might be diagonals(!) and for part 1 we needn't consider
 them.

 Just in case we need to pay attention to diagonals in part two, I need to write the
 point generator to handle both these cases. For now, I can eliminate the diagonals.

 Update: re-wrote the point generator, but it's ugly. I'm sure there's a better way
 to do it with Racket iterators. I'll investigate some day.

   --- Part Two ---
  
  Unfortunately, considering only horizontal and vertical lines doesn't give you the full
  picture; you need to also consider diagonal lines.
    
  Consider all of the lines. At how many points do at least two lines overlap?
