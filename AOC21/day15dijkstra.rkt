This is a classic path-finding problem. If you read "risk" as "distance" it's
pretty clear what I'll need to do . A little examination of the sample data
and optimum path shows that I can't simply select the lowest next point on the
grid I will have to try all paths and save the risk from each. I can brute force
 the sample data but it get's pretty big fast (as usual).

So optimizations: I can short-circuit any route by keeping track
of the lowest number I've found and stop a route if it gets higher. 

A couple of other points, we don't count the risk of the starting point, and
even though the instructions imply backtracking is allowed it seems like that
would never produce a lower risk.

As usual, I'll represent this 2D array as a vector using the Grid structure. Which
means I'll have to calculate the height and width of the grid, too. I'll also bring in
my point->pos and pos->point functions and a modified version of my surrounding points
function.

OK this is really slow. I guess I've come up with the naive solution. But I notice
that it's very fast if I start with a max-risk close to the actual answer. By
short-circuiting guesses that are too big I can really speed things up. I've
been using a simple max-risk generator (just a simple L-shaped path - which
generates 60 in the test-grid) but I think I'll try to grok and implement Dijkstra.

As I understand it, this algo spreads by starting at start, set distance to 0,
examine the (up to) four surrounding nodes, if none of them are the end point,
calculate the distance from start, and if it's lower than the node-dist replace
 node-dist. Once you've completed that for all the surrounding points, remove
start from the unvisited queue and pop the next point (the queue auto-sorts
so that the next point is always the one with the lowest node-dist). Repeat.

If Dijkstra isn't fast enough you can further optimize by adding a heuristic for
choosing the next item in the queue - that's called A*. The heuristic for
a grid like this is just "prefer down and to the right" - aka Manhattan. 

I'll use Racket's binary heap from data/heap for my priority queue.
