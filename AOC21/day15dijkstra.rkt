A little examination of the sample data and optimum path shows that I can't
simply select the lowest next point on the grid I will have to try all paths
and save the risk from each. I can short-circuit any route by keeping track
of the lowest number I've found and stop a route if it gets higher. 

A couple of other points, we don't count the risk of the starting point, and
even though the instructions imply backtracking is allowed it seems like that
would never produce a lower risk.

As usual, I'll represent this 2D array as a vector using the Grid structure. Which
means I'll have to calculate the height and width of the grid, too. I'll also bring in
my point->pos and pos->point functions and a modified version of my surrounding points
function.

OK this is really slow. I guess I've come up with the naive solution. But I notice
that it's very fast if I start with a max-risk close to the actual answer. By
short-circuiting guesses that are too big I can really speed things up. I've
been using a simple max-risk generator (just a simple L-shaped path - which
generates 60 in the test-grid) but I think I'll try my own version of Dijkstra:
go all the way down using the lowest risk at each point, creating a good first
guess. 

I'll use binary heap from data/heap. It's an implmentation of a priority queue
I'll use for
