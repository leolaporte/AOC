A little examination of the sample data and optimum path shows that I can't
simply select the lowest next point on the grid I will have to try all paths
and save the risk from each. I can short-circuit any route by keeping track
of the lowest number I've found and stop a route if it gets higher. 

A couple of other points, we don't count the risk of the starting point, and
even though the instructions imply backtracking is allowed it seems like that
would never produce a lower risk.

As usual, I'll represent this 2D array as a vector using the Grid structure. Which
means I'll have to calculate the height and width of the grid, too. I'll also bring in
my point->pos and pos->point functions and a modified version of my surrounding points
function.
